All entries become the property of Sponsor and will not be returned. Sponsor shall determine timeliness of entries in its sole discretion.
    <br><br><strong>Eligibility:</strong> Sweepstakes is open to legal residents of the fifty (50) United States and the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the territory of Guam who are 18 years of age or older as of the date of entry, except employees of Sponsor and its affiliates, subsidiaries, advertising and promotion agencies and the immediate family members and/or those living in the same household of each such employee. Sweepstakes is void where prohibited by law.

There is no cost to register. Then, post a review of any product and you will be automatically entered into the Sweepstakes. You may review as many products as you wish and each product review will constitute one (1) entry. All product reviews are subject to the Macy's Terms of Use and Customer Rating and Review Terms and Conditions. All product reviews must be in English. Sponsor does not guarantee the public posting of any product review and reserves the right, in its sole discretion, not to post your review for any reason, including, but not limited to, if it contains any of the following types of content or violates the Terms and Conditions: any content that infringes upon the copyrights of any third parties; contains obscene, lewd or offensive language; comments on other retailers or websites; comments on competitive products or other products, pricing or availability.
    <br><br>
    By submitting a product review as part of an online entry, entrant hereby grants permission, without limitation to other rights granted hereunder, for the product review to be posted on www.macys.com or other Sponsor websites. Entrant agrees that Sponsor is not responsible for any unauthorized use of product reviews by third parties. Multiple reviews of the same product are not valid. "SPAM" or fraudulent product reviews will not be posted and all entries from any such user will be void. Entries generated by a script, computer programs, macro, programmed, robotic or other automated means are void and will be disqualified. Entrants may not submit product reviews with multiple email addresses nor may entrants use any device or artifice to submit product reviews multiple times or as multiple entrants. Any entrant who attempts to submit product reviews with multiple email addresses, under multiple identities or uses any other device or artifice to submit product reviews multiple times or subvert the entry process will be disqualified from participation in the Sweepstakes, and all product reviews and entries submitted by that entrant will be void.
